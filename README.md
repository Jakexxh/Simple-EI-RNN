## Reaction-Time

> In the RT task, the choice targets were displayed for a variable interval before 
the onset of the motion stimulus. The duration of this prestimulus interval was randomly selected 
from an exponential distribution (mean 700 msec). This randomization served to discourage 
anticipation of the onset of the motion stimulus. We found that randomization of the prestimulus 
interval in this fashion was essential for training on the RT task. When the onset of the stimulus
 was predictable, RT was faster than in these experiments and varied less across the range of 
 coherences. Once the motion stimulus began, the monkey was free to indicate its choice at any time. 
 When the computer detected a break in ﬁxation, the random dots were extinguished. If the monkey
 made a saccade to either choice target, the trial was scored as correct or incorrect. 
 Breaks in ﬁxation that were not associated with an immediate saccade to a choice target 
 were rare and are not included in our data set.
